          - fidelity verification
        - propotion of each domain determined by ablation on small model
    - training
      - cosine decay is better than Warmup–Stable–Decay
      - long-context:
        - data:
          - genuinely long and coherent documents are very rare -> upsample
          - synthesize long-context data by concatenating documents and sub-tasks
        -  8k -> 64k -> 256k -> 1m
  - Post-train
    - Pipeline: sft -> rl (specialized domain experts at varying reasoning effor) -> mopd
    - SFT
      - data: expanded dataset from kimi-k2.5 by adding complex agentic tasks, trajs obtained using domain-specialized models from previous Kimi, their own agents.
        - kimi-k2 agentic sft data pipeline:
         - generate tool specifications
           - K2 used 3K+ real MCP tools and 20K+ synthetic tools
         - generate agents by combining system prompts with different tool sets
         - generate tasks and explicit evaluation rubrics based on agent 
         - generate trajs
           - most use tool simulators/world models for scalable synthetic execution
           - use real execution sandboxes for coding and SWE tasks
         - filter trajectories with rubric-based LLM judges + human-in-the-loop annotation

      - quantization-aware training from sft,  with MXFP4 weights and MXFP8 activations

        - same as kimi k2.5
          - grpo with token-level clipping (mask tokens when the current-to-rollout policy probability ratio is too large or too small)
      - Partial Rollout:
        - in each rollout step, parallelly run N groups, each generate K trajs, maintaining active workload of N*K trajs. Where a optimization step needs only $\lambda$*N groups.
        - As soons as getting $\lambda$*N trajs, pause rollout. partial trajs resume in next rollout step.
      - reasoning effort rl:
        - use the sft-ed checkpoint to estimate budget for each problem, T(y), set budget $tau$*T(y) for different reasoning effort models
        - first train a max-budget model with a relatively large budget(larger $tau$), then manually adjust $tau$ to train high and low effort models
      - Env:
        - Unified White-Box RL Environment: decompose an agent harness as modules, tools, system prompts, context management strategies, skills, memories, subagents, etc, when training, use this to compose different agents to increase diversity
        - Knowledge-Graph-Guided Task Synthesis:
          - built a knowledge graph to increase task synthesis diversity
            - The graph represents concepts from broad domains to fine-grained concepts, with edges from coarser concept to the finer one
            - building the graph: by agents,
              - initialized with predefined set of coarse-grained seed nodes (e.g., physics, coding)
              - each node is assigned with an agent, the agent does web search to find new concepts below the current one and add nodes, it decides when to stop
              - the newly added nodes are also assigned with an agent and loop
            - using the graph to generate tasks:
              - sample concepts from the knowledge graph, an agent would then do web search using the concept and ancestor's context, and use web search results to generate tasks.
    - MOPD:
      - mopd with all 9 teachers 
      - each time first sample a reasoning effort, then sample a domain, then use that specific teacher for mopd

## NVIDIA-Nemotron

- Nemotron-Cascade 2: Post-Training LLMs with Cascade RL and Multi-Domain On-Policy Distillation [[Arxiv'26/03](https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.19220)]
  - Post training pipeline built on top of Nemotron-3 (30B MoE model with 3B activated parameters)
  - SFT: 
    - Math, Code, Science, Agent (conversational tool use, SWE and terminal agents)
    - Use DeepSeek (Math) and GPT-OSS (Code) as the teacher model;
    - mixing agentic and agentless data yields better performance (swe)
  - Cascade RL
    - Determine the order: Mitigating Inter-Domain Interference (IF and RLHF are conflict); Scaling via Multi-Domain Integration (integrate domains are not conflict with the overall performance); Stabilization through On-policy Distillation
    - RL sampling and objective:
      - strict on-policy learning, with a REINFORCE objective (No trusted region):
      - $\mathcal{J}_{\text{GRPO}}(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{(q,a)\sim\mathcal{D},\{o_i\}_{i=1}^G\sim\pi_\theta(\cdot|q)}\left[\frac{1}{\sum_{i=1}^G|o_i|}\sum_{i=1}^G\sum_{t=1}^{|o_i|}\hat{A}_{i,t}\right]$, where $\hat{A}_{i,t}=\frac{r_i-\text{mean}(\{r_i\}_{i=1}^G)}{\text{std}(\{r_i\}_{i=1}^G)}$ for all $t$
    - Instruction-following RL: Filter out all correct/wrong samples; constrain the output length
    - Multi-domain RL & on-policy distillation: Large batch size & Distill from the strongest intermediate teacher models
      - $\mathcal{L}_{\text{MOPD}} = -\mathbb{E}_{x\sim\mathcal{D}, y\sim\pi^{\text{inf}}(\cdot|x)} \left[\frac{1}{|\mathcal{V}(y)|} \sum_{t\in\mathcal{V}(y)} w_t \, \text{sg}[a_t^{\text{MOPD}}] \log \pi^{\text{train}}(y_t|s_t)\right]$
      - $w_t$: truncated importance weight correcting for inference-training policy mismatch; $\text{sg}[\cdot]$: stop-gradient; $a_t^{\text{MOPD}}$: token-level advantage from domain-specific teacher models
      - teachers for mopd are selected directly from the Cascade RL pipeline by choosing the strongest validation checkpoint for each benchmark category
    - RLHF
    - Long-context RL: Use LLM as a judge for reward
    - Code and SWE RL: Long output token, binary reward, agentic RL as a much larger batch size and context length (use SWE-Gym + OpenHands); Do filtering 

- NVIDIA Nemotron 3: Efficient and Open Intelligence [[Arxiv'25/12](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20856)]
  - Family of Nano, Super, and Ultra models using hybrid Mamba-Transformer MoE architecture with up to 1M context length
  - Model: Hybrid Mamba-Transformer MoE: interleave MoE with Mamba-2 layers, which do not need linearly increasing KV Cache; LatentMoE (add a down proj in the input and up proj in the output)

  - New family launches (same report/recipe): Nemotron 3 Super (26/03, 120B mid-range) and Nemotron 3 Ultra (26/06, MoE 550B-A55, top US open-weights intelligence) trained with NVFP4 + LatentMoE + MTP layers; Nemotron 3 Nano Omni (26/04) adds unified vision/audio/image/text [[NVIDIA](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/nemotron/Nemotron-3/)]

- Nemotron 3 Super: Open, Efficient MoE Hybrid Mamba-Transformer Model for Agentic Reasoning [[Arxiv'26/04](https://arxiv.org/abs/2604.12374)]
  - Background: dense and standard MoE transformers pay quadratic attention + linearly growing KV cache at long context; the challenge is to push accuracy-per-FLOP and accuracy-per-parameter while keeping inference cheap enough for 1M-context agentic workloads
  - Model: 120.6B total / 12.7B active, 88 layers, hybrid Mamba-2 + MoE with sparse self-attention "global anchors" for full-token interaction
  - **LatentMoE**: project tokens into a 1024-d latent space for routing and expert compute, cutting memory bandwidth and all-to-all traffic so total/active experts can grow (512 experts, top-22 routing, model dim 4096)
  - **MTP layers**: shared-weight multi-token-prediction heads give native speculative decoding — 3.45 avg acceptance length on SPEED-Bench (draft length 7), beating DeepSeek-R1
  - **NVFP4 pre-training**: train directly in 4-bit FP (E2M1, 16-element micro-blocks) over 25T tokens (80% diversity, 20% quality phase)
  - used **PivotRL**
  - Results: comparable benchmark accuracy (MMLU 86.0, HumanEval 79.4, RULER@1M 71.0) at 2.2× inference throughput vs. GPT-OSS-120B and 7.5× vs. Qwen3.5-122B
 
- PivotRL: High Accuracy Agentic Post-Training at Low Compute Cost [[Arxiv'26/03](https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.21383)]
  - collect expert trajs with rejection sampling (SWE-bench, τ²-Bench， Terminalbench, browsecomp)
  - Find pivots: for each step, given all context before, and let the initial policy predict next step, use a binary verifier to score (based on expert action), only keep steps that the initial policy can get it correct in some cases but not all cases
  - RL on these pivot steps with the verifier

## Agentic RL

### Agent training framework
- Comparison of different frameworks [[anatomy-of-rl-frameworks](https://www.hanifleo.com/anatomy-of-rl-frameworks/)]
  - Rollout Architecture: Engine (Rollout happens in process) vs Server (Rollout runs as a separate service)
  - Weight Synchronization Strategy & worker organization
  - Parallelism model & Data flow pattern

- AREAL: A Large-Scale Asynchronous Reinforcement Learning System for Language Reasoning [[25/11](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.24298)]
  - Fully async with staleness-aware RL, better handle off-policy
  - SLIME is better at modularization and supports partial rollout

- Slime [[Github](https://github.com/THUDM/slime)]
  - Asynchronous rollout: Training and inference are fully separated using sglang
  - Customized rollout: Supports task-specific handling such as filtering incomplete/invalid trajectories
  - **Support partial rollout for efficiency:**
    - Issue: response lengths vary greatly between samples; traditional approach waits for the longest rollout, causing GPU idle time
    - Solution
      - Unfinished partial results are stored in a buffer and continued in the next round
      - Completed rollouts are immediately used for loss computation and optimization
      - Rollouts can interact across batches
  - Importance sampling for data reuse: Save logits at generation time to correct for policy drift ($\mathbb{E}_{a \sim \pi_{\text{old}}}[f(a)] = \mathbb{E}_{a \sim \pi_{\text{old}}}[\frac{\pi_{\text{new}}(a|s)}{\pi_{\text{old}}(a|s)} \cdot f(a)]$)
  - Note: Inference and training may have different precision, which can cause problems

### Overall recipes

- OpenClaw-RL: Train Any Agent Simply by Talking [[Arxiv'26/03](https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.10165)]
  - Unified RL framework built on SLIME: policy serving, rollout collection, PRM judging, and policy training are fully async
  - Leverage all evn. changes for training (next state signals): User replies, tool outputs, terminal responses, GUI state changes, error message
    - Evaluation signals are fed to PRM
    -  Directive signal: Hindsight-Guided On-Policy Distillation (OPD) extracts textual hints from the next state, constructs an enhanced teacher context, and distills token-level directional supervision back into the student, 

- Agentic Critical Training [[Arxiv'26/03](https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.08706)]
  - Collect expert data as reference and train the model to select better actions between reference and the model's own actions (enable the model to do critique)
  - Continue training the model with normal RL 

- Good SFT Optimizes for SFT, Better SFT Prepares for Reinforcement Learning [[Arxiv'26/02](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01058)]
  - Claims to address distribution mismatch between SFT samples (generated by teacher models) and RL samples (generated by the policy)
  - Token-level importance sampling, assigning large weights to SFT samples whose distribution more closely matches the current model
  - Train the model to not change too much from the current policy (based on the importance weights)

- Experiential Reinforcement Learning [[Arxiv'26/02](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2602.13949)]
  - Teach the model to do self-critique (similar to self-distillation but different methods)
  - Ask the policy to do two attempts in one response round, where the second response leverages the model's reflection of the first one   
  - Use RL to update the policy based on both attempts 
  - Use the second response for distillation (ask the model to output the second response without the reflection) 

- RLAnything: Forge Environment, Policy, and Reward Model in Completely Dynamic RL System [[Arxiv'26/02](https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2602.02488)]
  - Train a parametric and discrete intermediate reward model
  - Intermediate reward: Reward model rates the quality of each step m times, the final reward is the average of the m scores plus the final reward. The step-wise advantage is calculated by standardizing rewards across trajectories at the same step index.
  - The reward model is jointly optimized with the policy using a consistency feedback signal: $R_{S_{\tau_{i},j}} = R_{\tau_{i}} \cdot S_{\tau_{i,j}}$. 
    - USE RL loss to train or not? it needs to compute advantage...
  - The framework dynamically adjusts task difficulty when policy accuracy falls outside predefined thresholds ($\alpha_{low}=0.2, \alpha_{high}=0.8$). A language model modifies tasks to be harder or easier based on "critic feedback"—summarized error patterns provided by the reward model

- ComputerRL: Scaling End-to-End Online Reinforcement Learning for Computer Use Agents [[Arxiv'25/08](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14040)]
  - Implement API calls (via LLM) for agents to interact with the environment
  - Step reward is the same as the final reward

### Process rewards

- RLAR: An Agentic Reward System for Multi-task Reinforcement Learning on Large Language Models [[Arxiv'26/03](https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.00724)]
  - Static, domain-specific reward models generalize poorly to OOD scenarios during RL iterations
  - Use LLM agents to dynamically select/synthesize reward functions per query: retrieve reward models from the Internet and generate programmatic verifiers via code generation
  - Self-evolving reward system that adapts to shifting data distributions during training

#### Parametric reward model

- Agentic Reinforcement Learning with Implicit Step Rewards [[Arxiv’25/09](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19199)]
  - Train a PRM through DPO using the DPO loss and use it to train the policy together
  - Similar to PRIME and shows marginal improvements
  - PRIME uses MSE loss and this one uses preference loss but uses the policy model loss to train PRM
  - DPO vs CE loss for training PRM; 2. GRPO vs RLOO for calculating the reward

- SPA-RL: Reinforcing LLM Agents via Stepwise Progress Attribution [[Arxiv'25/05](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20732)]
  - Train an LLM as a progress estimator to assign a contribution score for each step
  - The sum of the contribution scores is the final reward (either 0 or 1)
  - Model assigns a reward to each step, training objective is to make the sum of the contribution scores close to the final reward (MSE loss) [No constraints on individual step scores]
    - May suffer from the non-identical issue

- Training Task Reasoning LLM Agents for Multi-turn Task Planning via Single-turn Reinforcement Learning [[Arxiv'25/09](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20616)]
    - Train LLM agents for multi-turn task planning by decomposing long-horizon tasks into single-turn reasoning problems, where the model (Qwen2.5-1.5B) learns to predict the correct next action at each state using GRPO with dense rewards from expert trajectories (Llama3-70B). Theory proves that improving single-step optimality leads to higher overall multi-turn success rate.

#### Non-parametric reward model

- Reinforcement Learning via Self-Distillation [[Arxiv'26/01](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.20802)]
  - $\mathcal{L}_{\text{SDPO}}(\theta) := \sum_{t} \text{KL}(\pi_{\theta}(\cdot \mid x, y_{<t}) \| \text{stopgrad}(\pi_{\theta}(\cdot \mid x, f, y_{<t})))$
  - $y$ is generated by giving only $x$ to model $\pi_{\theta}$, $f$ is the feedback from the environment.
  - Use $\text{log} \frac{\pi(y|x,f,y)}{\pi(y|x,y)}$ as the intermediate reward, $\pi(y|x,f,y)$ is the self policy as the teacher model.
  - All the experiments are conducted on single-turn tasks. When comparing this method with GRPO, the models are trained 1 hr and 5 hrs (a strange setting).
  - This method can work depending on whether the policy itself knows where it is wrong given the feedback.

### Objective functions & training scheduling 

- Maximum Likelihood Reinforcement Learning [[Arxiv'26'02](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02710)]
  - Use pass k rate as sample weight for training -> mimic the maximum likelihood loss
  - Compute gradient estimation as a REINFORCE-style with score function
  - Use unbiased estimation to reduce variance
  - Final gradient is similar to GRPO with pass rate as the sample weight 

- Harnessing Uncertainty: Entropy-Modulated Policy Gradients for Long-Horizon LLM Agents [[Arxiv'25/09](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09265)]
  - Expected gradient norm is monotonically coupled with policy entropy
  - $A_{mod}(i, t) = A^{i} * g(H_{t}) + f(H_{t+1})$
    - g(H_{t}): For a confident step, g(H_{t}) > 1, which amplifies its gradient; conversely, for an uncertain step, g(H_{t}) < 1, which attenuates its gradient.
    - f(H_{t+1}): encourages the agent to select actions that lead to a more predictable and less ambiguous future state
  - Task: Webshop and ALFWorld (i.e., agent benchmark with sparse reward)
  - LLM model: Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct, Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct

- Tackling Length Inflation Without Trade-offs: Group Relative Reward Rescaling for Reinforcement Learning (GR³) [[Arxiv'26/03](https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.10535)]
  - Problem: length inflation — model learns verbosity to maximize rewards. 
    - Additive length penalty $R' = R - \lambda \cdot L$ creates optimization shortcuts (model inflates $R$ to offset $\lambda \cdot L$)
  - GR³: multiplicative rescaling $\hat{R}^{(i)} = R^{(i)} \cdot \frac{1}{1 + \alpha \cdot \ell^{(i)} / \bar{\ell}}$ where $\ell^{(i)}$ is response length and $\bar{\ell}$ is group mean length.
    - Encourage high reward and short responses
    - This works within a group so only consider the relative length

- Differentiable Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning [[Arxiv'25/12](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13399)]
  - Automatically search the best combination of reward functions (e.g., format reward, length reward) via a meta reward function and train this reward function together with the policy

- Beyond Precision: Training-Inference Mismatch is an Optimization Problem and Simple LR Scheduling Fixes It [[Arxiv'26/02](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01826)]
  - Training-inference mismatch (e.g., vLLM vs FSDP) amplifies gradient noise, and both escalate together as training progresses. Since LR directly controls update magnitude, shrinking LR suppresses the mismatch by reducing the update size.
  - Response length serves as an early-warning signal for impending instability (longer responses → more gradient noise). Propose a dynamic LR scheduler that decays LR when response length grows, proactively preventing divergence.

- Single-Rollout Asynchronous Optimization for Agentic Reinforcement Learning [[Arxiv'26/07](https://arxiv.org/abs/2607.07508)]
  - Background:
    - Synchronous RL waits for the longest rollout in each batch; asynchronous actor-learner systems remove this barrier but introduce policy lag and off-policy updates
    - GRPO requires multiple rollouts per prompt and a group-relative baseline, forcing completed trajectories to wait for their group and making it unsuitable when an environment returns only one trajectory
  - Key problem & insight: stable asynchronous agent RL needs to train immediately from individual trajectories without group synchronization. A critic can supply single-rollout advantages if off-policy tokens are tightly filtered and the value model tracks the changing policy quickly
  - Proposed method — SAO with four components:
    1. **Direct Double-Sided Importance Sampling (DIS)**: compute token ratios directly against rollout-time log probabilities and mask tokens outside $[1-\epsilon_l, 1+\epsilon_h]$, preventing highly stale samples from contributing gradients
    2. **Single-Rollout Sampling**: use one rollout per prompt and send it to training immediately upon completion, reducing latency-driven staleness and supporting online environments with one feedback trajectory
    3. **Faster Value Update and Frozen-Attention**: update the critic twice per actor step and freeze its attention layers while training MoE projections, helping value estimates track policy changes without unstable full-model updates
    4. **Skip-Observation Token-level GAE**: propagate advantages directly between consecutive model actions while skipping externally generated observation tokens, avoiding noisy value transitions across tool or environment feedback
  - Results: trains stably for about 1,000 steps; on Qwen3-30B-A3B, SAO reaches 97.3/74.8/88.3/74.0 on AIME2025/BeyondAIME/HMMT/IMOAnswerBench versus 84.2/54.8/76.0/55.8 for GRPO, and improves SWE-bench Verified from 27.0 with GRPO+DIS to 29.8

### RL & OPD

OPD is actually doing policy gradient.

$\nabla_{\theta^S}L^{\text{token}} = \mathbb{E}_{v\sim p}\big[\nabla\log p_v\cdot(\log p_v - \log q_v)\big]$

advantage is $(\log p_v - \log q_v)$

- KDRL: Post-Training Reasoning LLMs via Unified Knowledge Distillation and Reinforcement Learning [arxiv’2506](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02208)
    - post-training target: $\mathcal{L}^{\text{KDRL}} = \mathcal{L}^{\text{GRPO}} + \beta_{\text{KD}}\cdot\text{KL}\big(\pi_S\,\parallel\,\pi_T\big)$
    - $\nabla J^{\text{KDRL}}_{i,t} = \big[A_{i,t}^{\text{GRPO}} - \beta_{\text{KD}}(\log\pi_S - \log\pi_T)\big]\cdot\nabla\log\pi_S$
- Reinforcement-aware Knowledge Distillation for LLM Reasoning [arxiv’2602](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22495)
    - In KDRL, the gradient part mixes the GRPO signal and OPD signal, the sign totally depends on the $\beta_{\text{KD}}$
    - GRPO gradient: $\min\big(\text{ratio}_{\text{GRPO}} \cdot \text{Adv},\;\text{clip}(\text{ratio}_{\text{GRPO}},\,1\pm\epsilon)\cdot\text{Adv}\big) \cdot \nabla\log\pi$
        - $\text{ratio}_{\text{GRPO}} = \frac{\pi_{S}}{\pi_{S_\text{old}}}$
    - OPD: $(\log\pi_S - \log\pi_T)\cdot\nabla\log\pi = \log\text{ratio}_{\text{OPD}} \cdot \nabla\log\pi$
    - TRDD: $\min\big(r^{\text{TRRD}}\cdot\text{Adv},\;\text{clip}(r^{\text{TRRD}}, 1\pm\epsilon)\cdot\text{Adv}\big)\cdot\nabla\log\pi$
        - $r^{\text{TRRD}} = (\text{ratio}_{\text{GRPO}})^{\alpha} \cdot (\text{ratio}_{\text{OPD}})^{1-\alpha}$
    - the advantage sign is still decided by GRPO, OPD only changes the magnitude of the advantage

### Sampling strategies

  - The experience extractor is trained based on whether its distilled experiences actually help the actor succeed — get reward based on the outcome reward of the traj it guides
  - Two models are trained async and interact via an experience manager
  - Improves sample efficiency by leveraging cross-episode experience; 10% improvement in single-task, scales to multi-task

- In-Context Reinforcement Learning for Tool Use in Large Language Models (ICRL) [[Arxiv'26/03](https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.08068)]
  - RL-only framework that eliminates SFT by using few-shot in-context examples during RL rollouts to teach tool invocation
  - Procedure: (1) prepend $k$ few-shot tool-use demos to the rollout prompt → (2) model generates its own tool-augmented trajectory and receives outcome reward → (3) update policy via RL → (4) curriculum: gradually reduce $k$ across stages (e.g., $5 \to 3 \to 1 \to 0$) until the model invokes tools zero-shot
  - In-context examples bootstrap exploration (so the model doesn't start from random tool calls), then get removed as the model internalizes the format

- Spark: Strategic Policy-Aware Exploration via Dynamic Branching for Long-Horizon Agentic Learning [[Arxiv'26/01](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.20209)]
  - Ask the policy to 'identify' the current state (in system prompt): either in explore state or normal thinking state (differentiated by the tag `[EXPLORING]` and `[THINKING]`). If identified as explore state, then the system will force beam search. The experiments show it is more effective than GRPO.

- R3L: Reflect-then-Retry Reinforcement Learning with Language-Guided Exploration, Pivotal Credit, and Positive Amplification [[Arxiv'26/01](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.03715)]
  - Algorithm (Use LLM to find important steps)
    - step 1: sample n/2 trajectories.
    - step 2: For each trajectory, use the current model to perform structural analysis: for example, error analysis, then provide improvement suggestions, and determine which step is the pivot step that caused the error
    - step 3: Retain the trajectory before the pivot step, given the error analysis and improvement suggestions, ask the LLM to continue generating the trajectory after the pivot
    - step 4: Combine the steps before the pivot step and the trajectory generated by step 3 after the pivot, forming a new set of n/2 trajectories.
  - Shared prefix does not calculate gradients
  - Scaling advantages to address difficult problems are mostly negative reward issues
  - Two additional SFT objectives were designed to enhance the model’s diagnostic and retry capabilities (useful for steps 2 and 3).

- Meta-RL Induces Exploration in Language Agents [[Arxiv'25/12](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16848)]
  - Rollout and training with cross-traj signals
  - After each traj finishes, prompt the agent to generate the textual reflection on this traj, providing specific feedback and plan to guide the next traj.
  - The return for each action is the sum of the discounted return of future actions plus the discounted return of future trajectories at step 0 (The step reward is provided by the environment or the task)

- Reflect, Retry, Reward: Self-Improving LLMs via Reinforcement Learning [[Arxiv'25/05](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24726)]

  - Aims to reduce the reasoning length and improve efficiency.

- Effective Harnesses for Long-Running Agents [[Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-harnesses-for-long-running-agents)]
  - Problems: Agent tries to one-shot complex tasks, runs out of context mid-implementation; later agent sees progress and declares done prematurely
  - Solution: Initializer agent sets up environment and progress file; coding agent makes incremental progress with structured updates
  - Open questions: Single general-purpose agent vs multi-agent architecture; generalization to other domains (scientific research, financial modeling)

- First return, then explore [[Nature'21/09](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-03157-9)]
  - Visual game exploration
  - Phase 1: Return and explore until solved -- record states based on similarity, select promising states (less explored or leading to more new states), replace states with better solutions (fewer steps)
  - Phase 2: Use SFT for robustification

- Exploration by Random Network Distillation [[Arxiv'18/10](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.12894)]
  - Encourages the agent to explore novel, unseen states
  - Two networks: a randomly initialized fixed target network and a predictor network trained to predict the target's output
  - Prediction error between the two networks is used as the intrinsic exploration bonus (higher error = state is novel = higher reward)
  - Based on visual games; using PPO with a Dual Value Head to separately estimate stationary extrinsic and non-stationary intrinsic rewards


### Stability and others

- Meta-Harness: End-to-End Optimization of Model Harnesses [[Arxiv'26/03](https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.28052)]
  - Harness: Code  determines what to store, retrieve, and show to the model, actually workflow (each harness is a single-file Python program
that modifies task-specific prompting, retrieval, memory, and orchestration logic)
  - Propose an agentic harness management system that propose new harnesses for new tasks based on existing harnesses stored in the file system
    - loop: run a benchmark, get the score and trace, let the coding agent retieve info (harness src, trace, score) and optimize the harness
  - Evaluation
    - On math reasoning, online text classification, and terminal-bench 2.0
    - Evaluated generalization for math reasoning and online text classification, didn't evaluate generalization for terminal-bench
  - Generated harness
    - Terminal-bench:
      - Before the agent starts, run a script that collects env info (e.g., packages, files under /app) and inject to the prompt.
    - online text classification:
      - harness 1:
        - step 1: for each new sample, find 5 existing closest samples, model predict a initial class.
        - step 2: retieve 5 closest samples within the predicted class, and 5 closest samples from other classes.
        - step 3: model predict the final class.
      - harness 2:
        - step 1: for each new sample, construct a prompt with all class names, find one closest sample for each class, and some ambiguous samples.
    - Math:
      - some rules describing how many samples to retrieve for each kind of question.

- Harness Design for Long-Running Application Development [[Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/harness-design-long-running-apps)]
  - Problems: context anxiety (model wraps up prematurely near perceived context limits); self-evaluation bias (agent praises its own mediocre work)
  - Solutions:
    - Frontend design: generator-evaluator loop (GAN-inspired); four gradable criteria (design quality, originality, craft, functionality); evaluator uses Playwright MCP to interact with live pages before scoring
    - Full-stack coding: three-agent architecture (planner → generator → evaluator) with sprint-based decomposition and file-based inter-agent communication. Before each sprint, the generator and evaluator negotiated a sprint contract: agreeing on what "done" looked like for that chunk of work before any code was written. 
  - Takeaway: separating creation from evaluation is more tractable than self-evaluation; convert subjective judgments into concrete gradable criteria

- Effective harnesses for long-running agents [[Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-harnesses-for-long-running-agents)]
  - For long-running agents, merely rely on compaction leads to problems
    - model running out of context in the middle of its implementation, leaving the next session to start with a feature half-implemented and undocumented
    - After some features had already been built, a later agent instance would see that progress had been made, and declare the job done
  - Solutions:
    -  The very first agent session asks the model to write a json of feature requirements expanding on the user’s initial prompt (each feature with description, steps, and status), and a claude-progress.txt file that keeps a log of what agents have done.
    -  Every subsequent session is prompted to firts read the progress.txt and git history, then work on one feature, commits the change (enabling easy reverts), then leaves updates in progress.txt. 

- The Optimal Token Baseline: Variance Reduction for Long-Horizon LLM-RL [[Arxiv'26/03](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07078)]
  - Standard REINFORCE-style leads to high variance for long-horizon tasks as noise accumulates and the reward is sparse
    - Existing baselines do not consider sequence heterogeneity and differences in sequence energy 
  - Propose a per-token optimal baseline: weighted average of the return, where the weight depends on the squared norm of the score function at each token (each token has its own baseline rather than a shared baseline for the sequence)

- Stabilizing Reinforcement Learning with LLMs: Formulation and Practices [[Qwen Team, Arxiv'25/12](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01374)]
  - Three issues: (1) training–inference discrepancy (FP8 vs. BF16); (2) policy staleness (due to asynchronous rollout); (3) training–inference discrepancy can cause inconsistent routed experts for MoE models
  - Existing solution:
    - (1) & (2): importance sampling
    - (3): routing replay (fix the expert used by inference when do training)
  - Given the assumption: the IS for each token is small: $1+\epsilon \ll 1$, the token-level optimization objective can be viewed as the first-order approximation of the sequence-level optimization objective.
  - Proposed MiniRL: GRPO + Clip (mask the gradient for tokens which are higher than a threshold when reward > 0 and lower than a threshold when reward < 0)
  - Evaluated on Qwen3-30B-A3B with synchronous training:
    - For on-policy training (the global batch size equals the mini-batch size):
      - MiniRL is the best, adding length normalization leads to suboptimal performance
    - For off-policy training:
      - Routing Replay and clipping become essential for stable training

- SimpleTIR: End-to-End Reinforcement Learning  for Multi-Turn Tool-Integrated Reasoning [[Arxiv'25/09](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02479)]
  - Problem: LLM-generated responses after multiple turns (with tool observation) are OOD compared to the pre-training and SFT data; each token has low probability, which leads to extremely high importance sampling ratio ($\frac{\pi_{\text{new}}(y)}{\pi_{\text{old}}(y)}$) for trajs with negative reward.
  - Solution: clipping the importance ratio is appealing but the threshold is hard to set. The authors filter out trajs with void turns (no tool invocation or final answer).
  - Scenario: Zero RL with math problems

- When Speed Kills Stability: Demystifying RL Collapse from the Training-Inference Mismatch [[Notion'25/10](https://yingru.notion.site/When-Speed-Kills-Stability-Demystifying-RL-Collapse-from-the-Training-Inference-Mismatch-271211a558b7808d8b12d403fd15edda)]
  - Mismatch between training and inference causes collapse of RL training: $\mathbb{E} _{x\sim \mathcal{D}}\mathbb{E} _{y\sim \textcolor{red}{\pi _{\theta}^{\mathrm{vllm}}}\left( \cdot |x \right)}\left[ R\left( x,y \right) \nabla _{\theta}\log \textcolor{blue}{\pi _{\theta}^{\mathrm{fsdp}}}\left( y|x \right) \right]$
  - Long context amplifies this issue as the difference is accumulated
  - The **agent** receives a tool response, which is often structured text (e.g., context enveloped by `<python_output>` and `</python_output>` tags) that is OOD compared to its pre-training and SFT data.Faced with this unfamiliar OOD context, the **agent's policy** becomes more uncertain, making it more likely to sample low-probability tokens in its subsequent turns (which is also observed in [**SimpleTIR**](https://github.com/ltzheng/SimpleTIR)).
  - Hardware differences also contribute to the instability
  - Solution: sequence-level importance sampling ($\frac{\textcolor{blue}{\pi_{\theta}^{\mathrm{fsdp}}}(y|x)}{\textcolor{red}{\pi_{\theta}^{\mathrm{vllm}}}(y|x)}$)

  - Problem: standard residual connections ($`\mathbf{h}_l = \mathbf{h}_{l-1} + F(\mathbf{h}_{l-1})`$) accumulate all layer outputs with fixed unit weights, causing uncontrolled hidden-state growth and progressive dilution of each layer's contribution
  - **AttnRes**: replace fixed accumulation with softmax attention over all preceding layer outputs
    - $`\mathbf{h}_l = \sum_{i=0}^{l-1} \alpha_{i \to l} \cdot \mathbf{v}_i`$, where $`\alpha_{i \to l} = \frac{\exp(\mathbf{w}_l^\top \text{RMSNorm}(\mathbf{k}_i))}{\sum_{j=0}^{l-1} \exp(\mathbf{w}_l^\top \text{RMSNorm}(\mathbf{k}_j))}`$
    - $\mathbf{w}_l \in \mathbb{R}^d$: learned pseudo-query per layer; $\mathbf{k}_i$: keys from prior layer outputs; $\mathbf{v}_i$: prior layer representations
    - Each layer selectively aggregates earlier representations with learned, input-dependent weights
  - **Block AttnRes**: partition layers into $N$ blocks; apply attention only over block-level representations instead of all layers, reducing memory from $O(Ld)$ to $O(Nd)$

- mHC: Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections [[Arxiv'25/12](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24880)]
  - Hyper connections extends standard Residual Connections by widening the residual stream and using dynamic mixing matrices instead of simple addition.
    - $y = W_{skip} \cdot x + W_{res} \cdot F(x)$ x here is the input, the shape is (n, d) where in residual stream is d. Hyper connections widen the residual stream.
  - Issue: HC breaks the Identity Mapping property, causing training instability and high memory access overhead.
  - Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections (mHC) projects the connection matrices onto Birkhoff polytope (the sum of each row and each column is 1).
  - Also provides the optimization for training mHC, including kernel fusion and memory efficient training.

- Kimi Linear [[ArxXiv'25.10](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26692)]
  - Propose Kimi Delta Attention
  - Kimi Linear can be a drop-in replacement for full attention architectures with superior performance and efficiency, including tasks with longer input and output lengths.

- Step-3 is Large yet Affordable: Model-System Co-Design for Cost-Effective Decoding [[Arxiv'25/07](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19427)]
  - System and model co-design
  - Key findings:
    - Neither total nor activated parameter count is a good indicator for decoding cost — architecture design matters more
    - Attention design dominates decoding cost, especially at longer contexts (attention cost grows with context while FFN cost stays constant)
    - Hardware-attention alignment is critical: MFA achieves arithmetic intensity of 128, well-matched to diverse hardware; DeepSeek-V3's MLA (intensity 512) bottlenecks on lower-tier accelerators
    - Over-sparse MoE models suffer efficiency losses despite fewer activated parameters — sparsity needs hardware-aware design (Hardware aware sparsity threshold)
  - **Multi-Matrix Factorization Attention (MFA)** [[Arxiv'24/12](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19255)]: low-rank factorization in QK circuit; share projection matrices across heads so only low-rank compressed KV needs caching. 
  - **Attention-FFN Disaggregation (AFD)**: decouple attention and FFN layers into specialized subsystems; attention is memory-bound (KV cache access) while FFN is compute-bound (matrix multiply)
    - Similar to NV models

## Text World Models
- From Word to World [[Arxiv'26/03](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18832)]
  - Reframe LLMs as text-based next-state predictors via SFT.
  - Key findings:
    - LLMs can serve as effective implicit text-based world models.
    - Mixing world-model-generated trajectories with real trajectories can improve task performance.
    - World-model warmup before Agent-SFT and RL improves learning stability and final performance

- Qwen-AgentWorld [[Arxiv' 26/06](http://arxiv.org/abs/2606.24597)]
  - Propose a unified language world model over 7 agentic environments: MCP, Search, Terminal, SWE, Android, Web, and OS.
  - Training recipe: CPT → SFT → RL
    - CPT injects environment dynamics and broad world knowledge from large-scale interaction trajectories and professional corpora.
    - SFT activates explicit next-state prediction reasoning through formatted environment trajectories, i.e., (s_t,a_t) -> s_t+1.
    - RL sharpens simulation fidelity using five-dimensional rubric rewards plus rule-based verifiers.
  - Training Tricks:
    - Use prompt diversification and best-of-3 rejection sampling to curate robust SFT reasoning traces.
    - Sample one prediction turn per trajectory during RL to avoid shared-prefix reward collapse.   
  - Key findings:
    - LWM-RL induces a transferable predict-before-act reasoning without explicit SFT supervision of the behavior.
    - World-model learning transfers across environments.
    - LWM-RL can serve as mid-training to improve performance on agent tasks.
